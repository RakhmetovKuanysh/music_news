+ Music News Project <br>
+
+ Description
+   The project is dedicated for people who are interested in latest news from the music world. It is a platform that contains all the information about leading charts, artists, video and interesting news.
    Basically, the whole project can be divided into 4 parts. The first one is obviously music. People go to such platforms like VK, Instagram to find latest news about music, but it is too inconvenient for them because the information is placed in different places. Our idea is to collect all data and place is in our project. For example, “New single from an artist was released” is an important news and has to be published as soon as possible. 
    The second one is video. Vevo channel is the father of all music video channels. So, getting newest videos is also fun and interesting for users.
    The third one is news. These news will be provided by our managers. We will suggest what is interesting and what album is estimated as the best one by music critics. 
    The last but not the least is charts. There are some freaks who are obsessed with knowing all the information from the charts. Huge platforms that really estimate music as it should be are Billboard, Spotify, Apple Music and iTunes Charts.<br>
